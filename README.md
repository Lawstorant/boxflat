### Ideas
- Telemetry ingestion through REST API/WebSockets
- Cammus support
- PXN Support
- Simagic support
- H-Pattern and Sequential settings available for arbitrary HID devices

### Firmware upgrades
There are some EEPROM functions available, but I need to do more testing to make sure I won't brick anything. For now, just use Pit House on Windows if you can, as FW upgrade support is not coming in the near future.

## Compatibility
Moza commands and their protocol is hardware agnostic, so any implemented feature should work with any wheelbase, wheel, pedal set etc. Some Wheel settings are device-specific (FSR Wheel dashboard for example)

Wheel indicator blinking colors can't be read from the wheel. This is a limitation of the current firmware.

Boxflat automatically detects is a device (shifter/pedals) needs a detection fix and creates a proper virutal device. This fixes game detection.

> [!TIP]
> Detection fix can be applied to any HID device as well (pedals, shifters, button boxes).

# Installation
## Flatpak (preferred method)
Boxflat is available on **[Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.lawstorant.boxflat)**

### Udev rule installation for flatpak
Copy this into terminal and execute with root permissions
```bash
sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-boxflat.rules <<< 'SUBSYSTEM=="tty", KERNEL=="ttyACM*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="346e", ACTION=="add", MODE="0666", TAG+="uaccess"'
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Unplug and plug in your deivce to trigger these new rules. Alternatively, you can reboot your system.
